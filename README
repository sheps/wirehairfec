A first attempt to fork Catid's original 'wirehairfec' distribution,
and provide a record of the status of ports to other languages.

Some possible ports are now being discussed:
o generic C++ (original project was developed in MS VisualStudio v??.??)
o Java
o Perl
o Python


** Please, add comments about current choices and future possibilities! **
